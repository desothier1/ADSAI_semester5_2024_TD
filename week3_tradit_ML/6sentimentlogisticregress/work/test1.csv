Leather, spice, tobacco and tea emerge from the nose of this Sicilian blend of Nero d’Avola, Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. You’ll get aromas of clove, allspice and vanilla behind vibrant blueberry and raspberry.	3/1/2009	unk

So pale that it’s almost colorless, the Blangé—made from Arneis grapes in Piedmont—has the oak-meets-citrus nose you’d expect of a Chardonnay. The lemon, grapefruit and pear flavors, coupled with a superspritzy, Asti-like mouthfeel, make this a good Sunday brunch eye-opener. Its slightly high acidity could cut through any French toast or waffle that you throw its way. Finishes medium-long, with herbal notes. 	9/1/2001	unk

Good, interesting wine from this specialty winery. It starts with clean, complex Zinny aromas of briary, brambly berries, and turns rich and complex on the palate. It’s bone dry, with the structure of a fine red wine, and Zin’s particular exuberance. The long finish suggests midterm aging potential. 	12/15/2001	unk

It’s a fair amount gamy, with caramel, warm earth and some bacon on the nose. There’s sweet berry fruit and licorice notes, but also a dry, peppery, woody character.

A lean, steely and slightly herbaceous Chardonnay, whose brisk elegance makes up for the absence of richness. This Chablis-style wine is marked by minerals and suggestions of lemons and limes, as well as strong acidity. Calls for fresh crab in the shell, with plenty of drawn butter for dipping.	8/1/2010	unk

What I like about Morgan’s Pinots is that they avoid the muscularity of certain Santa Lucia Pinots while retaining a ripe opulence.

For all intents and purposes, Masi makes this wine (but in conjunction with the Alighieri family). It’s leathery in the nose, with chocolate and raisin aromas. Prune and milk chocolate flavors dominate prior to a fairly long, textured finish. Let it be noted that one reviewer liked this wine quite a bit more than the other panelists, even going so far as to recommend it as an accompaniment to meats and cheeses.	5/1/2003	unk

With notes of buttered toast, honey and vanilla cream, this Chardonnay is overpowered by new oak barrel influences. Beneath that are delicious fruit flavors of pineapples, oranges, pears and apricots. Rich and flashy in the popular style, with good acidity, but the heavy hand of oak limits the score.	11/1/2011	unk

It’s an immaculate, elegant, complex wine, redolent of wet stone, dried herbs (thyme, rosemary), jicama, cucumber, lime, grapefruit, melon and more. It is clear and clean, precise and focused. It does not push the ripeness, or overshoot the cool vintage, and never sacrifices complexity. Fermented and aged in a concrete egg, it’s seen no oak at all.	12/31/2013	unk

Always a dense wine in youth, Keefer is an ager, and winemaker Ehren Jordan has captured its essence with this impressive young wine. Shows classic Russian River structure, with firm acids and a dusting of tannins that frame vibrant flavors of cherry, rhubarb, red currant, cola, pomegranate and cedar. Delicious and compelling, this wine will evolve for up to six years. 	8/1/2009	unk

Valpolicella Le Quare delivers rich, pulpy extraction on the nose, with a thinner, sour element in the mouth. Indeed, the nose and the palate of this easy wine don’t have much in common.

New toasty oak currently dominates, offering the butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel flavors that so many people think is the taste of Chardonnay, but is not.

Soft spice and ripe fruit continue in the medium-weight mouth, the fine grain tannins coating your palate and staying through the slightly chewy and fudgy close.

The nose has a severe case of funk and gaminess, with spice notes veering to cinnamon and red pepper flake.

The vineyard is in Oakville, and the wine, which is 100% Cabernet, shows classically firm tannins and Oakville’s signature blackberries and black currants.

Not overly sweet, this may be better with cheese or foie gras than with dessert, but it is a pleasant little sweet wine made from both Gros and Petit Manseng.
